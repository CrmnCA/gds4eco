# Environment {#sec-env .unnumbered}

This section details the set of local and online requirements needed to follow the course, as well as instructions to get set up on your own.

## Coding language

This course is primarily designed to introduce Geographic Data Science using Python as the core programming language. All course materials, assignments, and exercises are built with Python in mind, ensuring consistency and clarity throughout the learning process. Python was selected for its versatility, extensive libraries, and widespread use in the Geographic Data Science field, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and advanced users. If you are curious about conducting similar geospatial analyses in R, you can access additional resources [here](https://pietrostefani.github.io/gds/). However, for this course, all work should be completed in Python and following the environment setup that we introduce below.

## Reproducing code in this course

To run the analysis and reproduce the code in Python, you will need to set up your Python environment according to the following instructions. Please follow the instructions according to your operating system.

::: callout-note
Even if you have used Python before and have set up your own environment, we very much recommend following the set up described below to ensure you can run the code smoothly.
:::

Follow these instructions and test your installation **prior to the first session of the course**. Setting up the Python environment is necessary for:

-   Executing the Jupyter notebooks of the sessions of the course.

-   Preparing your own Jupyter notebooks.

To learn more about Jupyter notebooks, please visit [this site](Jupyter%20notebooks).

## Set up Python {.unnumbered}

### Installation of Miniconda {.unnumbered}

-   Install Miniconda on your personal laptop: Follow the instructions [here](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/miniconda-install.html).

-   During the installation, leave the default settings. In particular, when asked whom to "Install Miniconda for", choose "Just for me".

### Set up the Directories {.unnumbered}

-   Create a folder where you want to keep your work conducted throughout this course. For example, call it `gds4eco`. You can save it wherever you want, but remember to be tidy with your folder structure!

-   Download the [data](https://github.com/pietrostefani/gds/tree/main/data) to run and render the Jupyter notebooks. To learn how to download folders from github see the next section [@sec-download].

-   Unzip the folders and store the nested folders into a subfolder named `data` within the folder `gds4eco`.

-   Create another subfolder named `labs` within `gds4eco`.

The folder structure should look like:

```         
gds4eco/
├── data/
└── labs/
```

### Set up the Python Environment {.unnumbered}

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## MS Windows

-   Download the `gds4eco.yml` from GitHub by cliciking `Download raw file`, top right [at this page](https://github.com/pietrostefani/gds/blob/main/envs363-563.yml) **MODIFY**!

-   Save it in the folder `gds4eco` created before.

-   Type in the search bar and find the `Anaconda Prompt (miniconda 3)` in your personal computer. Launch it. The terminal should appear.

-   In the **Anaconda Terminal** write: `conda env create -n gds4eco --file M:\gds4eco\gds4eco.yml` and press `Enter`; if the file is located elsewhere you'll need to use the corresponding file path.
-   If you are prompted any questions, press `y`. This process will install all the packages necessary to carry out the lab sessions.
-   In the **Anaconda Terminal** write `conda activate gds4eco` and press `Enter`. This activates your working environment.

<img src="./img/Step3_py.PNG" width="80%"/>

-   Configuration of Jupyter Notebooks:

    -   In the **Anaconda Terminal**, write `jupyter server --generate-config` and press enter. This, at least in Windows, should create a file to: `C:\Users\username\.jupyter\jupyter_server_config.py`.

    -   Open the file with a text editor (e.g. [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org)), do a `ctrl-f` search for: `c.ServerApp.root_dir`, uncomment it by removing the \# and change it to `c.ServerApp.notebook_dir = 'M:\\your\\new\\path`, for example the directory where you created the `gds4eco` folder.

    -   Save the file and close it.

## Mac

-   Download the `gds4eco.yml` from GitHub by clicking `Download raw file`, top right [at this page](https://github.com/pietrostefani/gds/blob/main/envs363-563.yml).

-   Save it in the folder `envs363_563` created before.

-   Type in the search bar and open the **Terminal**.

-   In the **Terminal** write `conda env create -n gds4eco --file gds4eco.yml` and press `Enter`. This will need to be modified according to where you placed the `gds4eco` folder. For example, Elisabetta has named her folder `gds4eco` and it's in her Dropbox in `Users/PIETROST/Library/CloudStorage/Dropbox/envs363_563/envs363_563.yml`. If you created the `gds4eco` folder on your desktop, the path would be `Desktop/gds4eco`.

-   If you are prompted any questions, press `y`. This process will install all the packages necessary to carry out the lab sessions.
-   You should then see this

### Start a Lab Session {.unnumbered}

::: {.panel-tabset group="language"}
## MS Windows

-   Download the Jupyter Notebook of the session in your folder. Choose one Jupyter notebook and click `Dowload raw file` as shown below.

<img src="./img/Step5_py.PNG" width="80%"/>

-   Save the file in the `labs` folder within your `geo4eco` folder on your machine.
-   Type in the search bar, find and open the `Anaconda Prompt (miniconda 3)`.
-   In the **Anaconda Terminal** write and run `conda activate geo4eco`.
-   In the **Anaconda Terminal** write and run `jupyter notebook`. This should open Jupyter Notebook in your default browser.

<img src="./img/Step6_py.PNG" width="80%"/>

-   Navigate to your course folder in and double click on the notebook downloaded in step 1.
-   You can now work on your copy of the notebook.

## Mac

-   Download the Jupyter Notebook of the session in your folder. Choose one jupyter notebook and click `Dowload raw file` as shown below

<img src="./img/environ_Py_11.png" width="80%"/>

-   Save the file in the `labs` folder within your `envs363` folder on your machine.
-   Type in the search bar, find and open the **Terminal**.
-   In the **Terminal** write and run `conda activate envs363`.
-   In the **Terminal** write and run `jupyter notebook`.

<img src="./img/environ_Py_7.png" width="90%"/>

-   This should open Jupyter Notebook in your default browser. You should see something like this:

<img src="./img/environ_Py_9.png" width="80%"/>

-   Navigate to your folder. You can now work on your copy of the notebook.
